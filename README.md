# SBG_INV_FE

This is the `[S]`trategy `[B]`attle `[G]`ame `[Inv]`entory tracker - `[F]`ront `[E]`nd.

The game referred to is Games Workshop's Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game, a miniatures game
wherein you refight the battles from the _Lord of the Rings_ books and movies.

This is the front end which relies on the [sbg_inv_be](https://github.com/dptww1/sbg_inv_be) server to do the real
work.

This project was written in [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org).  While
it might seem like an appropriate choice just based on the
Tolkien-inspired name, I didn't choose it just to be cute.   It's
compact, speedy, and very well supported on its dedicated
[Zulip Channel](https://mithril.zulipchat.com).
I can't recommend it highly enough.
